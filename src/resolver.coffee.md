## Resolver

A **resolver** is an attenuation of a `Deferral`, where consumers are allowed
to attempt to affect the deferralâ€™s resolution state, but can neither observe
its state nor react to its resolution.

    class Resolver

      allowed =
        as: yes
        given: yes
        resolve: yes
        accept: yes
        reject: yes


### Constructor

        @_apply = ( method, args ) ->
          return unless allowed[ method ]
          deferral[ method ].apply deferral, args
          this
